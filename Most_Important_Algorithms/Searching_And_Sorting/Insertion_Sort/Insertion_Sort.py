Insertion Sort:
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing
cards in our hands.

Algorithms
// Sort an arr[] of size n
insertionSort(arr, n)
Loop from i = 1 to n-1.
.....a) Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence arr[0...i-1]

Another Example:
12, 11, 13, 5, 6

Let us loop for i = 1 (second element of the array) to 4 (last element of the array)

i = 1. Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and insert 11 before 12
11, 12, 13, 5, 6

i = 2. 13 will remain at its position as all elements in A[0..I-1] are smaller than 13
11, 12, 13, 5, 6

i = 3. 5 will move to the beginning and all other elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
5, 11, 12, 13, 6

i = 4. 6 will move to position after 5, and elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
5, 6, 11, 12, 13
