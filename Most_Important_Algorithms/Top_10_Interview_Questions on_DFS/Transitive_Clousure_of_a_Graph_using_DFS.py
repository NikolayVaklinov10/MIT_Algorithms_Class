Transitive Closure of a Graph using DFS
Given a directed graph, find out if a vertex v is reachable from another vertex u
for all vertex pairs (u, v) in the given graph. Here reachable mean that there is
a path from vertex u to v. The reachability matrix is called transitive closure
of a graph.

Transitive closure of above graphs is
     1 1 1 1
     1 1 1 1
     1 1 1 1
     0 0 0 1

We have discussed a O(V3) solution for this here. The solution was based
Floyd Warshall Algorithm. In this post a O(V2) algorithm for the same is
discussed.

Below are abstract steps of algorithm.


Create a matrix tc[V][V] that would finally have transitive closure of given
graph. Initialize all entries of tc[][] as 0.
Call DFS for every node of graph to mark reachable vertices in tc[][]. In
recursive calls to DFS, we donâ€™t call DFS for an adjacent vertex if it is already
marked as reachable in tc[][].

Below is implementation of the above idea. The code uses adjacency list
representation of input graph and builds a matrix tc[V][V] such that tc[u][v]
would be true if v is reachable from u.
